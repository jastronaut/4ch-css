# 4ch-css

*wintery chan*
A messy userstyle for 4chan, made mostly to help me learn HTML and CSS.

### notes

I've only tested this out on Chromium. (I usually use Firefox, not sure why I didn't use it earlier lol.) If it does not work, I'd love to work on a Firefox fork in the future.

### todo

- clean up formatting
- test on firefox
- adjust color palette to match bottom image
