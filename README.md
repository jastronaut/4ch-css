# 4ch-css

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jastronaut/4ch-css/master/previews/momoiro_dark.png)

i wanted to learn css, so i started making 4chan styles as practice.

### contents

there are three  styles in this repo (in order of addition date). check previews folder for more screens.

1. **wintery**, a christmassy style complete with a floating waifu and christmas gifs -- Uses [SFNS Display](https://github.com/supermarin/YosemiteSanFranciscoFont)
2. **normal**, a much more toned down style, light with pink accents -- Uses [SFNS Display](https://github.com/supermarin/YosemiteSanFranciscoFont)
3. **momoiro.css** (pictured above), based on the previous style, but dark and made to match my current gtk theme in my dotfiles repo -- uses [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans) but would look good with any monospace font

## notes

in the 'normal' and 'wintery' previews, commit-sudoku's [firefox css](https://github.com/commit-sudoku/firefox-css/) is used. the the 'momoiro' preview, a modified version of twily's [powerline firefox css](https://userstyles.org/styles/102262/twily-s-powerline-firefox-css) is used.

## TODO

- clean up files
- make up an actual title for normal.css
