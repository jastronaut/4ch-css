# 4ch-css

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jastronaut/4ch-css/master/previews/momoiro_dark.png)

i wanted to learn css, so i started making 4chan styles as practice.

### contents

there are three  styles in this repo (in order of addition date). check previews folder for more screens.

1. **wintery**, a christmassy style complete with a floating waifu and christmas gifs
2. **normal**, a much more toned down style, light with pink accents
3. **momoiro.css** (pictured above), based on the previous style, but dark and made to match my current gtk theme -- check my dotfiles.

## TODO

- clean up files
- make up an actual title for normal.css
