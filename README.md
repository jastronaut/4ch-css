![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jastronaut/4ch-css/master/previews/normal_thread.png)

i wanted to learn css, so i started making 4chan styles as practice.

### contents

there are two styles in this repo:

- **wintery.css**, a christmassy style complete with a floating waifu and christmas gifs
- **normal.css**, a much more toned down style. pictured above.

## TODO

- clean up files
- make up an actual title for normal.css
